<br>
A site catering to those who wish to predict rainfall on a certain day in Mumbai, India.
<br><br>
The problem Rainfall Prediction Portal solves
<p>
The project helps in predicting the amount of rainfall in Mumbai on a given day of a month and atmospheric conditions using a machine learning model trained on a dataset quite accurately using XGBoost machine learning algorithm which considers the sine wave nature of weather. The project also helps visualize the amount of rainfall against various factors such as humidity and temperature over Matlab plots generated through real world data obtained from weather stations and served on the web portal itself.
<br>
The interface and project are backed by a Flask server built entirely by us and when deployed on cloud, it can serve people as well as researchers through a beautifully built web portal which relies on HTML and CSS.
It also stores the result of input and predicted output at an instance and can send the results to the mail inbox of the person utilising the web service.
<br>
Ultimately, it provides a complex ML based rain prediction model that can be easily customised through few tweaks to code for researchers as well as common people to use on an elegantly made dynamic web portal.
