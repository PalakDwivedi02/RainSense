    <h3>What is Rainfall?</h3>
    
    <p> Rainfall is the water that falls from the clouds to the ground. It is a very important natural phenomenon. It is the
    source of water for the plants and animals. It is also the source of water for the human beings. </p>

    <h3>What is Rainfall Prediction?</h3>

    <p> Rainfall prediction is the process of forecasting the amount of rain that will fall in a given area. It is a very
    important process in agriculture, hydrology, and meteorology. It is also important for the planning of water
    resources and for the management of water supply and flood control. </p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>

    <p> Rainfall prediction is based on the analysis of the atmospheric conditions that are likely to produce rain. The
    atmospheric conditions that are likely to produce rain are called the "precipitation producing conditions". The
    precipitation producing conditions are the temperature, humidity, and wind speed. </p>

    <h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>

    <p> Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence. It is the study of algorithms that can learn from data. It
    is a very important field of computer science. It is used in many fields like robotics, natural language processing,
    and computer vision. </p>

    <h3>How is rainfall prediction useful?</h3>

    <p> Rainfall prediction is very useful for the farmers. It helps them to plan their farming activities. It also helps
    them to plan the irrigation of their crops. It is also useful for the water resources management. It helps them to
    plan the water supply and flood control. </p>

    <h3>How to use this website?</h3>

    <p> This website is very easy to use. You just need to enter the following details: </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Month and Day </li>
        <li> Temperature </li>
        <li> Specific Humidity </li>
        <li> Relative Humidity </li>
    </ul>

    <p> 
        After entering the details, click on the "Predict" button. The website will predict the rainfall for the next day.
    </p>

    <h3>How accurate is the prediction?</h3>

    <p> 
        The prediction is very accurate. The accuracy of the prediction takes advantage of the best machine learning model
        for rainfall predictions.
